## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
***
Welcome to my profile. My name is Masi from The-Coding-Classroom. I am a Maths/Physics/Chemistry teacher with a Master's degree in Science and Engineering from Tampere University of Technology. Right now programming is a hobby and a learning experience for me, but I'm committed to acquiring enough knowledge to turn it into a career, one way or the other.

Currently I'm into writing small automation scripts that help me compile graded assessments into course grade automatically. But I dream big and would love to implement my own ideas for "the perfect web platform for hosting courses online".
